; Fitter Messages ;
+-----------------+
Warning (18236): Number of processors has not been specified which may cause overloading on shared machines.  Set the global assignment NUM_PARALLEL_PROCESSORS in your QSF to an appropriate value for best performance.
Info (20030): Parallel compilation is enabled and will use 10 of the 10 processors detected
Info (119006): Selected device 5CEBA2F17A7 for design "UART_APB_Interface"
Info (21077): Low junction temperature is -40 degrees C
Info (21077): High junction temperature is 125 degrees C
Info (171003): Fitter is performing an Auto Fit compilation, which may decrease Fitter effort to reduce compilation time
Warning (292013): Feature LogicLock is only available with a valid subscription license. You can purchase a software subscription to gain full access to this feature.
Warning (15714): Some pins have incomplete I/O assignments. Refer to the I/O Assignment Warnings report for details
Critical Warning (169085): No exact pin location assignment(s) for 104 pins of 104 total pins. For the list of pins please refer to the I/O Assignment Warnings table in the fitter report.
Info (184020): Starting Fitter periphery placement operations
Info (11191): Automatically promoted 2 clocks (2 global)
    Info (11162): PCLK~inputCLKENA0 with 194 fanout uses global clock CLKCTRL_G10
    Info (11162): PRESETn~inputCLKENA0 with 194 fanout uses global clock CLKCTRL_G8
Info (184021): Fitter periphery placement operations ending: elapsed time is 00:00:00
Info (176233): Starting register packing
Critical Warning (332012): Synopsys Design Constraints File file not found: 'UART_APB_Interface.sdc'. A Synopsys Design Constraints File is required by the Timing Analyzer to get proper timing constraints. Without it, the Compiler will not properly optimize the design.
Info (332144): No user constrained base clocks found in the design
Info (332143): No user constrained clock uncertainty found in the design. Calling "derive_clock_uncertainty"
Info (332123): Deriving Clock Uncertainty. Please refer to report_sdc in the Timing Analyzer to see clock uncertainties.
Info (332130): Timing requirements not specified -- quality metrics such as performance may be sacrificed to reduce compilation time.
Info (176235): Finished register packing
    Extra Info (176219): No registers were packed into other blocks
Info (11798): Fitter preparation operations ending: elapsed time is 00:00:04
Info (170189): Fitter placement preparation operations beginning
Info (14951): The Fitter is using Advanced Physical Optimization.
Info (170190): Fitter placement preparation operations ending: elapsed time is 00:00:38
Info (170191): Fitter placement operations beginning
Info (170137): Fitter placement was successful
Info (170192): Fitter placement operations ending: elapsed time is 00:00:02
Info (170193): Fitter routing operations beginning
Info (170195): Router estimated average interconnect usage is 0% of the available device resources
    Info (170196): Router estimated peak interconnect usage is 2% of the available device resources in the region that extends from location X33_Y11 to location X43_Y22
Info (170199): The Fitter performed an Auto Fit compilation.  Optimizations were skipped to reduce compilation time.
    Info (170201): Optimizations that may affect the design's routability were skipped
Info (170194): Fitter routing operations ending: elapsed time is 00:00:01
Info (11888): Total time spent on timing analysis during the Fitter is 0.80 seconds.
Info (334003): Started post-fitting delay annotation
Info (334004): Delay annotation completed successfully
Info (334003): Started post-fitting delay annotation
Info (334004): Delay annotation completed successfully
Info (11801): Fitter post-fit operations ending: elapsed time is 00:00:06
Info (144001): Generated suppressed messages file D:/Digital Design/Quartus Projects/UART_APB/output_files/UART_APB_Interface.fit.smsg
Info: Quartus Prime Fitter was successful. 0 errors, 5 warnings
